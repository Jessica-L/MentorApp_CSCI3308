<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
The purpose of this site is to create a web app focused toward Computer Science enthusiasts and beginner programmers. Users will be able to seek guidance about computer science related topics from mentors (college students, certified teachers/professors and industry professionals in the field) and each other in a controlled, friendly online environment. Our app will also serve as an opportunity for industry professionals, teachers and Computer Science students to “pay it forward” and volunteer their time and expertise to help others. In the future, we aim to customize this service to middle schoolers and highschoolers in hopes our service will help bridge the gap in comprehension between middle school and the college-level expectations of a computer science degree program.
